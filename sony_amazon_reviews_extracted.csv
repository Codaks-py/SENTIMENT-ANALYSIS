"4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones, 1 problem",Mark D. Schnittman,4,"These are good headphones. I used them primarily for use with my tablet to watch NFL football and movies. The are comfortable and have good sound quality. The build quality is OK - not sure how well all that plastic will hold up over time. The biggest problem for me was the controls. You can tell that whoever designed the buttons have never used them. The buttons are impossible to tell apart with your fingertips. Every time I want to adjust the volume I have to spend 15 seconds searching for the right button - they all feel the same to the touch. Incredibly stupid design, especially considering that these are made by Sony - masters of industrial design. It also would have been nice if they came with a case to keep them in, like my old Aiwa's did. I haven't used the ANC, so I can't comment on that feature. So far, the battery life seems excellent. I have used them for approx. 10 hours, and the battery is still 90%. There is a companion app used to control the headphones, but I'm not certain if it's required to pair and use them.","Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2023",8

The are comfortable and have good sound quality. The build quality is OK - not sure how well all that plastic will hold up over time. The biggest problem for me was the controls. You can tell that whoever designed the buttons have never used them. The buttons are impossible to tell apart with your fingertips. Every time I want to adjust the volume I have to spend 15 seconds searching for the right button - they all feel the same to the touch. Incredibly stupid design, especially considering that these are made by Sony - masters of industrial design. It also would have been nice if they came with a case to keep them in, like my old Aiwa's did. I haven't used the ANC, so I can't comment on that feature. So far, the battery life seems excellent.

"4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones, 1 problem",Mark D. Schnittman,4,"These are good headphones. I used them primarily for use with my tablet to watch NFL football and movies. The are comfortable and have good sound quality. The build quality is OK - not sure how well all that plastic will hold up over time. The biggest problem for me was the controls. You can tell that whoever designed the buttons have never used them. The buttons are impossible to tell apart with your fingertips. Every time I want to adjust the volume I have to spend 15 seconds searching for the right button - they all feel the same to the touch. Incredibly stupid design, especially considering that these are made by Sony - masters of industrial design. It also would have been nice if they came with a case to keep them in, like my old Aiwa's did. I haven't used the ANC, so I can't comment on that feature. So far, the battery life seems excellent. I have used them for approx. 10 hours, and the battery is still 90%.
