A Sentiment analysis on the reviews from Sony WH-CH720N, an amazon headphone,
Firstly, I had to scrape the reviews using Oxylabs(limited version).
Saved the scraped data to a file, but i wasn't getting what i needed as it is all in a column.
So I evtracted the data and saved to another file which i will be using for the sentiment analysis.
The sentiment analysis analysis turns out to be positive all through.
